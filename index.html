										I was born and raised in The Netherlands - Europe and moved to the United States in 2008. Getting cultured is my number one passion, knowing people, places, religions, language phrases and foods of different ethnicities is the global connection to my heart. I have worked in different countries and still always long for exploring and deep diving into the possibilities this world has to offer. 
										<br>
										<br>
								         I studied Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering. As the driver of innovative technology I strive to use my knowledge to make a difference. When I am not at my full-time nine-to-five, I am a consultant at various start-ups. I have joined the Coding Bootcamp to practice fluency using front-end languages to position myself back in the "everyday coding" seat and further engage in my ineffable passion for developing technologies. My motto is always to "work smarter, not harder" and "every problem has a solution". 
								         <br>
								         <br>
								         In my free time I am hypnotized by music production, exploring hiking trails with my dog, cooking up world recipes and always in search for bakeries with the best custard filled pastries.</p>
